The mod was developed as part of a course project during our studies. The completion took approximately four months, followed by several additional months of refining before its official release.

This is our first mod that we have ever created, hence we had to learn everything from scratch. It was a fascinating journey and an enjoyable experience.

During the development process, we utilized various sources to acquire the knowledge necessary to meet the previously established requirements. Special thanks deserve to be mentioned for the YouTube channel: Kaupenjoe, which was particularly invaluable.
